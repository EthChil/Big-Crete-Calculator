### Connection to FPGA Board
[[FPGA Board]]
- Connected over M.2 (will require multiple)
- Switch inputs (21 Lines)
- RGB LEDs (63 Lines)
- Power
- PCIE Boot card
- Display (27 Lines)

### Power **Break this out into it's own document**
FPGA Rails
[[FPGA Board]]

Battery Management
- Charge
- Balance (if multiple cells)
- Undervoltage protection (power down)
- Charge percentage

**TODO Select Battery**

Display Rails
**TODO create document for display**

LED Driver
**TODO create document for LEDS**

### LED + Driver
[[LED + Driver]]
- one RGB LED per switch (21 RGB LEDs 63 LEDs (21 x 3)) (consider driving with a decoder and charlieplexed array)
- Additional RGB around the design

### Wireless Charger
- Qi Charging 

### LCD Display
- Serial control from FPGA
- Clock generated by FPGA

### Ribbon Expansion
- Ability to add a coprocessor (microcontroller)
- Ability to add an ADC

### PCIE Boot
- EEPROM bootcard 
- ability to flash cards from vivado
- easily swapped in and out

### Switches
- 21 switches
- Reed switch for power on power off (switch using a MOSFET)
- whatever is required to get the switches to interact with the FPGA properly
