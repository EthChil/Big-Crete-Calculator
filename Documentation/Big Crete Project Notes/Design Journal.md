- Doing design work before I start at NVIDIA
- Current status
	- SPD breakout board designed and arrived I know the pinout is for DDR3 and not DDR3L which may affect the ability for it to be used
	- LCD Display breakout is finished being designed just needs to be ordered
	- LED Breakout is not designed schematic or layout
	- Power is not designed schematic or layout

- By the end of today I want to have the LED breakout designed and laid out
- If possible I'd also like to start working on the power circuitry
- I may get cut short since I have a new computer arriving and I may get caught up setting that up
