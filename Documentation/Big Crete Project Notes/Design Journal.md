- Doing design work before I start at NVIDIA
- Current status
	- SPD breakout board designed and arrived I know the pinout is for DDR3 and not DDR3L which may affect the ability for it to be used
	- LCD Display breakout is finished being designed just needs to be ordered
	- LED Breakout is not designed schematic or layout
	- Power is not designed schematic or layout

- By the end of today I want to have the LED breakout designed and laid out
- If possible I'd also like to start working on the power circuitry
- I may get cut short since I have a new computer arriving and I may get caught up setting that up

May 2nd, 2021
- I got caught up setting up my new workspace and computer
- None of the items from the previous logs were done at all and remain outstanding
- For today I plan to complete the schematic for the LED breakout using the LTSpice simulations I did from HOLO as a reference since that seemed to work fairly well

May 3rd, 2021
- Today was my first day at NVIDIA 
- Yesterday I looked at the ltspice sims for the LED driver circuitry
- Today I plan on taking a look at the breadboard I made for that and modifying the circuit and doing additional analysis
- I'll attach the math for that analysis here
