refer to [[V2/Architecture V2/Rev A Issues Log|Rev A Issues Log]] this is where I am tracking changes from Rev A that fix problems this V2.5 could be considered to be a Rev B of sorts but I am going to include some more major changes as well

Components that need to be ordered 
- display
- switch hot swap mounts
- RGB LEDs
- LEMO connector and panel mount
- thru hole header
- harwin pins 0.5mm pitch

Switchboard modification
- the pots were moved down so it doesn't intersect with the USB port anymore
- the board outline was modified so that the display pins don't need to pass through the switchboard

Mainboard modification
- add lemo as switch
- easy to access pads for measuring the battery voltage
