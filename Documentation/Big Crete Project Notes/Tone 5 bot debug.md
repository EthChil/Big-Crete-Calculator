Observed encoder signal "leaking" into SDA or SCL can't remember which one.

Checking for shorts the SDA and SCL appear to be isolated from the encoder pins on both sides for both encoders. 

After looking at encoder outputs to SCL line it is clear that SCL is connected to L_ENC_A as the waves are the same.

when checking with a multimeter to see the resistance it reads out as 385 Ohm
